"""
Receipt Daemon
===========

A tiny CLI that prints haunted, surreal snippets via OpenAI.
Pick a category or let it choose one at random. Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in
your environment (use a .env file for local dev).

Quick start:
    Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file
    python receipt_demon.py --category copypasta --temperature 1.4

Add or tweak styles in CATEGORY_PROMPTS. The overall vibe lives in BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT.
