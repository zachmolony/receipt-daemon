receipt_demon.py
=================

This module provides a simple command‚Äëline interface for generating
one‚Äëoff pieces of haunted, surreal text from a collection of prompts.
The script encapsulates all the behaviour described in our conversation:

* A single base system prompt defines the personality of the "entity" that
  will answer. In this case it's a sentient thermal receipt printer
  that prints disturbing, glitchy thoughts. You can customise this
  prompt as needed.
* A dictionary of category‚Äëspecific prompts tells the model what kind
  to generate. Each entry corresponds to a different flavour of output:
  haunted shopping lists, paranoid prophecies, glitch poetry and more.
* The script establishes a connection to the OpenAI API using the
  official Python SDK. It expects your API key to be available in
  the environment variable ``OPENAI_API_KEY``. It will raise a
  ``ValueError`` if no key is found.
* On each run, the script selects a category‚Äîeither randomly or via the
  ``--category`` flag‚Äîconstructs the appropriate chat completion
  request, and prints the model‚Äôs response to stdout. The temperature
  can be adjusted via ``--temperature`` (default 1.0).

To use this script from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
   python receipt_demon.py --category haunted_shopping_list --temperature 1.2

If you omit ``--category``, a random category will be selected. You
can edit the ``CATEGORY_PROMPTS`` dictionary below to add, remove or
modify categories without changing the core logic. The system prompt
itself is defined in ``BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT``‚Äîtweak this to adjust the
character of the responses. For additional fields or more complex
behaviour (like printing directly to a thermal printer), this file
serves as a starting point.
